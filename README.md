# Simple-Ollama-Gradio
Easy to install and run AI chat using Ollama, Gradio and the Gemma 2 2B LLM.

This can run on a basic Linux computer. Based on testing, gemma 2 2B can run on older 4th Generation Intel CPU and Mac M1 chip. No fancy hardware required.

The script was written and tested on Ubuntu 24.04.1.

To run:
./ollama_gradio.sh
Connect your browser to http://127.0.0.1:7860
ctrl+c to exit when finished

The script will automatically install any necessary components and then run the chatbot
